# replica-test

Reads the flows in `replica/recon.md`. Writes `replica/test-plan.md`,
`replica/bugs.md`, and end-to-end tests in the project (`e2e/`). Templates in
this folder: `test-plan.md`, `bug-report.md`, `e2e.example.spec.ts`.

## The rule

**Test your clone, not the original.** Never load test, fuzz, script or
hammer the original app's servers. Using the original by hand, as a normal
user, to see how it behaves is fine.

## Step 1: the plan

For every flow F01, F02... in the recon map, write:

- **Happy path**: the steps, and what the user should see at the end.
- **Edge cases** that apply. Go down this list for every flow:
  empty input, very long input, emoji and accents, two tabs at once,
  double click on submit, back button mid-flow, refresh mid-flow, slow
  network, offline, expired session, second user's data (must be invisible),
  time zones and daylight saving, mobile width, keyboard only, screen reader
  labels.
- **Negative cases**: wrong password, card declined (Stripe test card
  `4000 0000 0000 0002`), permission denied, deleted record.

Number every case: F01-H1, F01-E3, F01-N2.

## Step 2: automate what you can

Playwright, one spec per flow, against the local dev server with seed data.
Use roles and labels for selectors (`getByRole('button', { name: 'Book' })`),
never CSS classes. See `e2e.example.spec.ts`.

```bash
npm i -D @playwright/test && npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright test
```

Add to every spec: fail on console errors, fail on any 5xx response, and an
axe accessibility scan (`@axe-core/playwright`) on each screen.

## Step 3: click through the rest

What cannot be automated (emails arriving, OAuth with real providers,
payments end to end, visual glitches) gets a manual pass. If a browser tool is
available, drive the local clone with it and screenshot each step. Otherwise
give the user the checklist and wait for answers.

## Step 4: report bugs

Every bug goes in `replica/bugs.md` in the `bug-report.md` format: an ID, a
severity, exact steps, expected, actual, evidence. Severity:

| | means |
| --- | --- |
| S1 | data loss, security hole, payments wrong, core flow blocked |
| S2 | a feature broken, no workaround |
| S3 | broken with a workaround, or visibly wrong |
| S4 | cosmetic |

Only report what you reproduced. "Might be an issue" goes in a separate
"to check" list.

## Step 5: fix loop

Fix S1 and S2 first. For every fix: write the failing test first, fix, watch
it pass, keep the test. Re-run the whole suite after each batch. Update
`bugs.md` with the commit that fixed each one.

## Output

`test-plan.md`, the specs, `bugs.md`, and a summary: cases run, passed,
failed, bugs by severity, fixed so far. Ship nothing with an open S1. Next:
`@replica-diff`.


## ChatGPT execution contract


Apply these adaptations throughout this workflow:

- Discover available tools. Use web search for public research and current facts, GitHub for repository work, and browser interaction under its access rules. Never invent tools, visits, screenshots, reviews or checks.
- Use Sites building and hosting skills for complete websites when applicable. Preserve existing repository stacks, including native Kotlin or Swift. Verify current API, pricing, store and hosting requirements from official sources; reference defaults and lint limits are starting points.
- Study public pages, screenshots, docs and authorized account views. Write implementation fresh. Exclude proprietary code, private endpoints, target identity and licensed content.
- Resolve `<skill-root>` to this skill's actual directory. Run Python tools with `python3 <skill-root>/<tool>.py` from the project directory. Run `--help` for exact arguments. Tools use the standard library. Templates and tools are in this skill folder; themes.json is beside reviews.py. Copy templates into the project before editing; leave installed resources unchanged.
- Keep project evidence in `replica/`. Save standalone deliverables with the Library skill. Keep repository-backed project files in their repository.
- Preserve source links, collection dates, sample sizes and uncertainty. Follow quotation limits; use short cited excerpts rather than redistributing whole reviews. Never use competitor reviews as testimonials.
- Record features as yes, partial, no or skip with reasons. A partial must-have blocks shipping. Missing screenshots mean no measured layout score. A final shippable verdict also requires verified core flows, feature score 80+, and no open S1/S2 bugs. Scores alone do not establish readiness.
- Use test credentials and payment test mode. Keep secrets out of chat, output and tracked files. Follow the account and credential handling rules of actual tools.
- Complete authorized work without repeated confirmations. Finish a reviewable preflight before asking for any new approval. Publish within existing authorization. Do not send outreach, buy domains or make real purchases without explicit authorization.


For tools belonging to another stage, resolve that named skill independently from the installed skill catalog, or use the sibling folder in this source repository. Do not assume installed skills retain neighboring folder names. If the other skill is unavailable, report that dependency and continue independent work.
