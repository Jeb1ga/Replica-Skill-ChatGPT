description: >-
  Ships an app clone live on the user's own domain: a preflight gate (tests
  green, parity must-haves done, rebrand sweep clean, listing linted, legal
  pages up), production database and env vars, the host, DNS records for the
  domain and for email, Stripe live mode, OAuth redirects, monitoring, and
  mobile builds to TestFlight and Play. Use when the user says "deploy it",
  "ship it", "put it live", "connect my domain", "go to production",
  "publish the app", or after @replica-launch.

# replica-deploy

Reads everything in `replica/`. Writes `replica/deploy.md` (the checklist in
`preflight.md` in this folder, filled in).

## The rules

- **Nothing goes live without the user's go.** Show the preflight results. An existing explicit deployment request supplies authorization; ask before any additional unrequested production action.
- **The user buys and signs in.** ChatGPT never buys a domain, enters a card,
  types a password or pastes a live key. ChatGPT writes the exact DNS records,
  env var names and commands; the user does the account steps.
- **Not until it is rebranded.** The sweep must be clean. No exceptions.

## Step 1: preflight

Run every check and paste the results into `deploy.md`:

```bash
npx playwright test                                                  # replica-test
python3 <replica-diff-root>/parity.py replica/features.csv               # must-haves done
python3 <replica-brand-root>/sweep.py . --config replica/brand.json      # exit 0: clean
python3 <replica-launch-root>/listing.py replica/launch/listing.json     # if shipping to stores
npm run build                                                        # production build passes
```

Resolve each named skill root independently to its installed folder.

Plus by hand: no open S1 or S2 bugs, privacy policy and terms pages live
(listing every processor), cookie banner if you use non-essential cookies in
the EU or UK, account deletion works, the favicon, titles and OG image are
yours.

Any failure stops the deploy. Say which and why.

## Step 2: production services

- A **separate production project** for the database (never the dev one),
  backups on, migrations run by the deploy, not by hand.
- Env vars set in the host for production, matching `.env.example`. Live
  keys only here.
- **Stripe**: switch to live mode, recreate products and prices, add the
  production webhook endpoint and its signing secret, test one real
  purchase and refund it.
- **OAuth**: add the production domain to every provider's redirect URIs and
  authorised origins. Google scopes that need verification must be approved,
  or only test users can sign in.
- **Email**: the sending domain verified with the provider.

## Step 3: host and domain

Default: Vercel for Next.js (Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, Fly or Render
otherwise). Connect the repo so `main` deploys and pull requests get preview
URLs.

The domain, after the user buys it at any registrar:

| record | name | value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | @ | the host's apex IP (Vercel: shown in the domain settings) |
| CNAME | www | the host's target (Vercel: `cname.vercel-dns.com`) |
| TXT | @ or a subdomain | the host's verification value, if asked |

Email DNS from the email provider: SPF (TXT), DKIM (CNAME or TXT), and a
DMARC record starting at `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:you@yourdomain` then
tightened to `quarantine` once reports are clean. Without these, your
confirmation emails go to spam.

Pick one canonical host (apex or www) and redirect the other. HTTPS is
automatic on the hosts above; check it.

## Step 4: watch it

Error tracking (Sentry or the host's), uptime checks on the home page and the
core flow's API, logs kept, analytics (a privacy-friendly one avoids the
cookie banner), and an alert to the user's email or phone. Then do the core
flow on the live site yourself, and ask the user to do it on their phone.

## Step 5: mobile, if there is an app

Expo: `eas build` then `eas submit` to TestFlight and Play internal testing.
Native: archive in Xcode, upload to App Store Connect; Gradle bundle to Play
Console. The user owns the developer accounts ($99 a year for Apple, $25 once
for Google). Beta first, then review with the listing from replica-launch.

## Output

`replica/deploy.md` with every check and its result, the live URL, the DNS
records set, and what to watch in the first week. The clone is now an app
with your name on it.

## ChatGPT compatibility

Use available tools under their actual access and credential rules. Research public information with web search; interact with accounts only when authorized. Never invent reviews, screenshots, test results or parity scores. Follow quotation limits. Verify current provider, store and hosting requirements. Preserve the user's existing stack; use Sites skills for complete websites when applicable.

Resolve `<skill-root>` to this skill's installed folder. Resolve another named skill independently through the skill catalog; do not assume installed folders stay adjacent. Run tools with Python from the app project directory. Templates remain beside SKILL.md; copy them into the project before customizing. Keep repository work in its repository; use Library for standalone deliverables when available.

A partial must-have blocks shipping. Without screenshots, mark layout unassessed. Tool scores alone do not establish readiness. Complete authorized work without repeated confirmations; prepare preflight before requesting any new production authorization. Real purchases and outreach require explicit permission.
