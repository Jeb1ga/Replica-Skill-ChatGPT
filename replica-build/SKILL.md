description: Use when implementing a clone from recon and design specs, building its shell, core flow, screens and all interaction states.

# replica-build

Reads `replica/recon.md`, `replica/architecture.md`, `replica/design/`.
Updates `replica/features.csv` (the `clone` column) and keeps
`replica/build-log.md`.

## The rules

- **Clean room.** Every line of code is written here, from the recon map and
  the specs. Never paste the original's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVGs or
  images, never load anything from its domain or CDN, never "view source and
  adapt".
- **Your words.** Write every label, button, empty state and email fresh.
  Matching what a button does is parity. Matching its sentence is copying.
- **Tokens only.** No raw hex or pixel values in components. If a value is
  missing, add it to the tokens.

## Step 1: the shell

Routing for every screen in the inventory (stub pages are fine), the layout
(nav, header, sidebar), tokens wired in, the primitives from replica-design,
and seed data so screens have something real to show. Commit.

## Step 2: the vertical slice

The core loop from the recon map, end to end, before anything else. For a
booking app: create an event type, open the public page, book a slot, see it
on the dashboard. Ugly is fine. Working is the point. If replica-backend has
not run yet, use the seed data and a fake data layer with the same function
signatures, so swapping in the real one changes no screen code.

## Step 3: screen by screen

Work in the order of `architecture.md`. For each screen:

1. Read its row in the recon map: purpose, components, states, which flows
   pass through it.
2. Look at the reference screenshot for layout and hierarchy. Not for pixels.
3. Build it with the primitives. Real data from the data layer.
4. **Every state**: empty, loading (skeletons, not spinners, if the original
   does), filled, error, no permission, long content (a 60 character name),
   mobile width.
5. Basics, every time: semantic HTML, labels on inputs, keyboard reachable,
   visible focus, images with alt text.
6. Set the matching rows in `features.csv` to `yes` or `partial` (with a note).
7. Screenshot it at the same viewport as the reference into
   `replica/clone-screens/S07.png` for replica-diff.
8. One commit per screen: `build: S07 booking page`.

## Definition of done, per screen

- [ ] every state from the recon map, plus empty, error and loading
- [ ] works at 390px and 1440px wide
- [ ] keyboard only: can complete the flow
- [ ] no console errors
- [ ] no hard-coded copy borrowed from the original
- [ ] features.csv updated
- [ ] screenshot saved for diff

## Step 4: the build log

`replica/build-log.md`, one line per screen: ID, date, done or partial, what
is missing, what was harder than expected. When a feature is bigger than it
looked, say so in the log and in the chat. Do not quietly ship half of it.

## When you are stuck on how something works

Go back to the original as a user: read its help article, watch its public
walkthrough, use the user's own account. Do not dig into its code or network
calls. Then build your own version of the behaviour.

## Output

Screens built, the feature matrix updated, screenshots saved, and a summary:
screens done of total, must-haves done of total, what is next. Then
`@replica-backend` if the data layer is still fake, else `@replica-test`.


## ChatGPT execution contract


Apply these adaptations throughout this workflow:

- Discover available tools. Use web search for public research and current facts, GitHub for repository work, and browser interaction under its access rules. Never invent tools, visits, screenshots, reviews or checks.
- Use Sites building and hosting skills for complete websites when applicable. Preserve existing repository stacks, including native Kotlin or Swift. Verify current API, pricing, store and hosting requirements from official sources; reference defaults and lint limits are starting points.
- Study public pages, screenshots, docs and authorized account views. Write implementation fresh. Exclude proprietary code, private endpoints, target identity and licensed content.
- Resolve `<skill-root>` to this skill's actual directory. Run Python tools with `python3 <skill-root>/<tool>.py` from the project directory. Run `--help` for exact arguments. Tools use the standard library. Templates and tools are in this skill folder; themes.json is beside reviews.py. Copy templates into the project before editing; leave installed resources unchanged.
- Keep project evidence in `replica/`. Save standalone deliverables with the Library skill. Keep repository-backed project files in their repository.
- Preserve source links, collection dates, sample sizes and uncertainty. Follow quotation limits; use short cited excerpts rather than redistributing whole reviews. Never use competitor reviews as testimonials.
- Record features as yes, partial, no or skip with reasons. A partial must-have blocks shipping. Missing screenshots mean no measured layout score. A final shippable verdict also requires verified core flows, feature score 80+, and no open S1/S2 bugs. Scores alone do not establish readiness.
- Use test credentials and payment test mode. Keep secrets out of chat, output and tracked files. Follow the account and credential handling rules of actual tools.
- Complete authorized work without repeated confirmations. Finish a reviewable preflight before asking for any new approval. Publish within existing authorization. Do not send outreach, buy domains or make real purchases without explicit authorization.


For tools belonging to another stage, resolve that named skill independently from the installed skill catalog, or use the sibling folder in this source repository. Do not assume installed skills retain neighboring folder names. If the other skill is unavailable, report that dependency and continue independent work.
