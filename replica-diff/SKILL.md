# replica-diff

Two tools in this skill folder, both standard-library Python, no installs:

```bash
python3 <skill-root>/parity.py replica/features.csv                         # feature parity + missing list
python3 <skill-root>/imgdiff.py replica/screens/S07.png replica/clone-screens/S07.png --out diff-S07.png
python3 <skill-root>/imgdiff.py a.png b.png --json > replica/diffs/S07.json # for parity.py --visual
python3 <skill-root>/parity.py replica/features.csv --visual replica/diffs/*.json --markdown > replica/parity.md
```

## What parity means here

**Parity means it does the same job, not that it looks the same.** The
feature score is the number that matters: can a user do everything they could
do in the original. The layout score checks structure (is the information in
the same places, in the same hierarchy), because that is what makes a switcher
feel at home. It deliberately ignores colour, because replica-brand changes
every colour on purpose. Do not chase pixel parity with the original. Its
exact look is its trade dress, and it changes before launch.

## Step 1: feature parity

Make sure `replica/features.csv` is current: every row's `clone` column is
`yes`, `partial` (with a note), `no`, or `skip` (with a reason). Then:

```bash
python3 <skill-root>/parity.py replica/features.csv
```

It weights must 3, should 2, could 1, counts partial as half, leaves out
`skip` rows and rows you added that the original does not have, and prints:
the score, must-haves done of total, each area weakest first, and the missing
list in build order. Must-haves not done means not shippable, and it says so.

## Step 2: layout diff

For each key screen, take two screenshots at the **same viewport** (1440x900
desktop, 390x844 mobile) in the **same state** (same data shape, same tab
open, logged in the same way). The original's come from public pages or the
user's own account, saved in `replica/screens/`. The clone's go in
`replica/clone-screens/`.

```bash
python3 <skill-root>/imgdiff.py replica/screens/S07.png replica/clone-screens/S07.png --out replica/diffs/S07.png
```

Layout mode (default) turns both into edge maps, cuts them into a grid, and
compares where things are, scoring only cells with something in them. It
reports the score (matches 90+, close 75+, partly 50+, different), the
regions that differ (in the original's pixel coordinates, biggest first), and
a height difference if the clone's page is much longer or shorter. Retina and
non-retina screenshots compare fine: both are scaled to the same width.

`--mode pixel` is exact comparison. Use it for your own regressions (clone
today against clone last week), not against the original.

## Step 3: behaviour diff

Walk each flow in both apps and compare what the scores cannot see: clicks to
finish the core flow, what happens on errors, what is remembered between
visits, what emails arrive. Fewer clicks than the original is a win. Write
each difference as: flow, original does, clone does, fix or keep.

## Step 4: the report

`replica/parity.md`: overall score, feature score, layout score per screen,
missing features in build order, behaviour differences, and a verdict:

- **not shippable**: any must-have missing, or any open S1 bug
- **shippable**: all must-haves done, feature score 80+, no open S1 or S2
- **better than the original**: shippable, plus fixes from
  replica-entrepreneur. This is the goal. A straight copy has no reason to exist.

Give honest numbers. A clone at 62% is at 62%.

## Output

`replica/parity.md`, the diff images, and the top five things to build next.
Then `@replica-build` for the gaps, or `@replica-entrepreneur` if parity is
there.


## ChatGPT execution contract


Apply these adaptations throughout this workflow:

- Discover available tools. Use web search for public research and current facts, GitHub for repository work, and browser interaction under its access rules. Never invent tools, visits, screenshots, reviews or checks.
- Use Sites building and hosting skills for complete websites when applicable. Preserve existing repository stacks, including native Kotlin or Swift. Verify current API, pricing, store and hosting requirements from official sources; reference defaults and lint limits are starting points.
- Study public pages, screenshots, docs and authorized account views. Write implementation fresh. Exclude proprietary code, private endpoints, target identity and licensed content.
- Resolve `<skill-root>` to this skill's actual directory. Run Python tools with `python3 <skill-root>/<tool>.py` from the project directory. Run `--help` for exact arguments. Tools use the standard library. Templates and tools are in this skill folder; themes.json is beside reviews.py. Copy templates into the project before editing; leave installed resources unchanged.
- Keep project evidence in `replica/`. Save standalone deliverables with the Library skill. Keep repository-backed project files in their repository.
- Preserve source links, collection dates, sample sizes and uncertainty. Follow quotation limits; use short cited excerpts rather than redistributing whole reviews. Never use competitor reviews as testimonials.
- Record features as yes, partial, no or skip with reasons. A partial must-have blocks shipping. Missing screenshots mean no measured layout score. A final shippable verdict also requires verified core flows, feature score 80+, and no open S1/S2 bugs. Scores alone do not establish readiness.
- Use test credentials and payment test mode. Keep secrets out of chat, output and tracked files. Follow the account and credential handling rules of actual tools.
- Complete authorized work without repeated confirmations. Finish a reviewable preflight before asking for any new approval. Publish within existing authorization. Do not send outreach, buy domains or make real purchases without explicit authorization.


For tools belonging to another stage, resolve that named skill independently from the installed skill catalog, or use the sibling folder in this source repository. Do not assume installed skills retain neighboring folder names. If the other skill is unavailable, report that dependency and continue independent work.
