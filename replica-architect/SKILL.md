# replica-architect

Reads `replica/recon.md` and `replica/features.csv`. Writes
`replica/architecture.md` (template: architecture.md in this folder).

If there is no recon map, stop and run `@replica-recon` first. Planning a
clone from memory of what an app does is how you miss half of it.

## Step 1: the stack

Use what the user already knows if they have a stack. Otherwise the default,
because every part is managed, documented and cheap at zero users:

| layer | default | swap for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| web app | Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript | Remix, SvelteKit, Rails |
| styling | Tailwind, tokens from replica-design | CSS modules |
| mobile | Expo (React Native) | SwiftUI, Kotlin |
| database | Postgres on Supabase or Neon | PlanetScale, SQLite (Turso) |
| ORM | Drizzle or Prisma | raw SQL |
| auth | Supabase Auth or Auth.js | Clerk |
| payments | Stripe Checkout + Billing | Lemon Squeezy, Paddle |
| email | Resend or Postmark | SES |
| jobs | Vercel Cron, Inngest or Trigger.dev | a worker on Fly |
| files | Supabase Storage or Cloudflare R2 | S3 |
| hosting | Vercel | Netlify, Fly, Render |

Write each choice with one line of why. One database. No microservices. The
clone does not need the original's architecture, it needs the original's
features.

## Step 2: the schema

Turn the inferred data model into SQL. For every table:

- `id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid()`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- an owner column (`user_id` or `org_id`) on everything a user owns
- foreign keys with an `on delete` rule decided, not defaulted
- indexes on every foreign key and every column you filter or sort by
- enums or check constraints for status fields
- times as `timestamptz`, always, stored in UTC
- money as integer cents plus a currency column
- access rules: Postgres row level security on Supabase, or one
  authorisation check per query in the data layer. Write which.

Example, for a booking app:

```sql
create table bookings (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  event_type_id uuid not null references event_types(id) on delete cascade,
  host_id uuid not null references users(id) on delete cascade,
  start_at timestamptz not null,
  end_at timestamptz not null,
  guest_name text not null,
  guest_email text not null,
  guest_timezone text not null,
  status text not null default 'confirmed'
    check (status in ('confirmed','cancelled','rescheduled')),
  answers jsonb not null default '{}',
  created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  constraint no_zero_length check (end_at > start_at)
);
create index on bookings (host_id, start_at);
```

Then the hard constraints the recon found. Two guests booking the same slot
is a database problem (an exclusion constraint or a unique index), not a UI
problem.

## Step 3: the API

One table per flow from the recon map. For every route or server action:

`method path | what it does | who can call it | input | output | flow`

Plus webhooks in (Stripe, calendar providers) and out, and background jobs
(reminders, sync, cleanup) with their schedule.

Only official, public APIs with the user's own keys. Never the original app's
private endpoints, even if they are visible in a browser.

## Step 4: the parts that bite

Write a line on each that applies: time zones and daylight saving, idempotency
(webhooks arrive twice), race conditions, rate limits, file size limits,
search, realtime, offline, email deliverability, multi-tenancy, GDPR deletion.

## Step 5: build order

1. **Vertical slice.** The core loop end to end, ugly: sign up, do the one
   thing, see the result. Proves the stack.
2. **Must-haves** from `features.csv`, by area.
3. **Should-haves**, then could-haves.
4. **The fixes** replica-entrepreneur finds, once it has run.

Each milestone lists its screens (S-IDs), tables and routes.

## Output

`replica/architecture.md`, the SQL in `replica/schema.sql` or as the first
migration, and a summary: stack in one line, table count, route count, the
three riskiest parts, and the next step: `@replica-design`.

Apply these adaptations throughout this workflow:

- Discover available tools. Use web search for public research and current facts, GitHub for repository work, and browser interaction under its access rules. Never invent tools, visits, screenshots, reviews or checks.
- Use Sites building and hosting skills for complete websites when applicable. Preserve existing repository stacks, including native Kotlin or Swift. Verify current API, pricing, store and hosting requirements from official sources; reference defaults and lint limits are starting points.
- Study public pages, screenshots, docs and authorized account views. Write implementation fresh. Exclude proprietary code, private endpoints, target identity and licensed content.
- Resolve `<skill-root>` to this skill's actual directory. Run Python tools with `python3 <skill-root>/<tool>.py` from the project directory. Run `--help` for exact arguments. Tools use the standard library. Templates and tools are in this skill folder; themes.json is beside reviews.py. Copy templates into the project before editing; leave installed resources unchanged.
- Keep project evidence in `replica/`. Save standalone deliverables with the Library skill. Keep repository-backed project files in their repository.
- Preserve source links, collection dates, sample sizes and uncertainty. Follow quotation limits; use short cited excerpts rather than redistributing whole reviews. Never use competitor reviews as testimonials.
- Record features as yes, partial, no or skip with reasons. A partial must-have blocks shipping. Missing screenshots mean no measured layout score. A final shippable verdict also requires verified core flows, feature score 80+, and no open S1/S2 bugs. Scores alone do not establish readiness.
- Use test credentials and payment test mode. Keep secrets out of chat, output and tracked files. Follow the account and credential handling rules of actual tools.
- Complete authorized work without repeated confirmations. Finish a reviewable preflight before asking for any new approval. Publish within existing authorization. Do not send outreach, buy domains or make real purchases without explicit authorization.


For tools belonging to another stage, resolve that named skill independently from the installed skill catalog, or use the sibling folder in this source repository. Do not assume installed skills retain neighboring folder names. If the other skill is unavailable, report that dependency and continue independent work.
